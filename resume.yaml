# - YAML for main content source
# - LaTeX for presentation
# - Cheetah for templating (delimiters, variables, for... in, etc.)
# - Python for YAML + template --> LaTeX resume
# - GNU Make for easy compilation
# - Vim for editing all files
# - Git for revision control, diff, backup, branching, etc.
#
# - HTML & CSS soon to come
#
# Cons:
#   - difficult to micromanage individual placements, etc.
#
# Pros:
#   - Really easy to apply changes everywhere. Eg: Don't display dates on extracurriculars, increase spacing between all items by x px, etc.
